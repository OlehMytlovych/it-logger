What is it for?

  It is an internal app for an IT department. When some computer stops working or network crashes etc., a person can add a log about this issue assigning a technician to fix it. This log is sent to db.json and can be edited(when you click on the text of log) or deleted. And this will have effect on db.json too.

React + Redux, materialize. The work is in progress.
